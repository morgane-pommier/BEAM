# CHANGELOG

WGBYC2025
- Set BEAM up to automatically detect its working directory (it'll use the 
  directory it's running out of), so that we can use relative paths throughout.
  This helps make BEAM more agnostic towards the specific system it's running on.
  
- BEAM can now automatically download data directly from the ICES database. For this
  to work, you have to specify the username of an account that has access, and 
  generate a token (see more detailed instructions elsewhere).

- Added a progress bar to calc_bpue(). This adds a little bit of overhead to the 
  calculations, and if turns out that this overhead is too much, we might consider
  removing it again. Also, this means we have to use another package, doSNOW, for
  our parallel backend. We also needs the "progress" package.

- Added a annotate_bpue function to add extra information to the table of BPUE
  estimates

- Moved code to convert 2-character country codes into 3-letter country codes into 
  its own function clean_country_code() and put it in a separate R file.

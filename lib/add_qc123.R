#' Final quality checks and colour coding
#' 
#' @description
#' `add_qc123` Adds columns QC1, QC2 and QC3 to the provided data.table.
#' 
#' @details
#' QC1: Observed vs. total effort makes sense
#'      - green = fishing effort <= monitoring effort for all vessel categories
#'      - red = monitoring effort > fishing effort for one or more vessel categories
#'      
#' QC2: Data availability for total bycatch estimation
#'      - green = there is both monitoring effort and total effort for all vessel categories
#'      - yellow = there is monitoring effort, but no total effort for one or more vessel categories
#'      - red = there is neither monitoring effort, nor total effort for one or more vessel categories
#'  
#' QC3: Availability of levels of random effects (REs) that are part of the model
#'      - green = there is data for all levels of all REs, if the model uses any REs
#'      - yellow = some levels lack data, but the only RE is year
#'      - red = there is no data for one or more levels of at least one RE
#'       
#' @param tot The data.table to be annotated; i.e. the result of a call to `calc_total()`.
#' @param obs A data.table containing all observed fishing effort, usually `obs2`
#' @param all A data.table containing all fishing effort, usually `all2`.
#' @param cols The columns specified when running `calc_bpue`. 
#' @returns A data.table, i.e. a copy of `tot`, with new columns for QC1, QC2 and QC3.
#' @seealso [calc_total()]
#' @export
#' @example
#' Read data:
#' tot <- fread("data/tot.csv")
#' obs2 <- fread("data/obs2.csv)
#' all2 <- fread("data/all2.csv")
#' Run QC checks:
#' tot2 <- add_qc(tot = tot, obs = obs2, all = all2, cols = c("ecoregion", "metierl4"))

# TODO: Why are we passing it obs3? Should we change the function to take obs3 rather than obs2?
add_qc123 <- function(tot, obs, all, cols) {
    
    # aggregate data on the columns specified, AND the vessellength column.
    # why do we also split by vessellength?
    # this was discussed during a plenary session at WGBYC 2023. The consensus then 
    # was that including vessellength was a more precautionary approach, since 
    # pooling data from different vessel length groups may not be appropriate.
    qc_obs <- obs[, .(das = sum(daysatseaob)), c(cols, "vessellength_group")]

    tot <- copy(tot)

    # logic in the following code
    tot[, c("QC1", "QC2", "QC3") := list("red", "red", "green")]
    
    # QC1 - MONITORING EFFORT VS FISHING EFFORT -------------------------------
    # More monitoring effort than fishing effort (*if dbsg was done correctly this should not be a problem)
    # Could happen that when there are simultaneous monitoring (e.g., EM and SO)
    # Green = no, fishing effort >= monitoring effort
    # Red = yes, monitoring effort > fishing effort
    qc[, QC1 := ifelse(all(das_obs <= das_all), "green", "red"), cols]
    tot[qc, on = cols, QC1 := i.QC1]

    # Data availability to calculate total BPUE by ecoregion, metier lvl 4 and species
    # Green = if there is both monitoring effort and total fishing effort
    # Yellow = if there is NO fishing effort but YES monitoring effort
    # Red = if there is NO monitoring effort and NO total fishing effort

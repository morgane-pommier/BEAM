build the code for BEAM

This version (version 2 - 16 Oct 2025) is the version which will be reviewed at ICES WKBBEAM (1-5 Dec 2025).

The original idea of BEAM was developed by Marjorie Lyssikatos and David Lusseau.

The code was developed by David Lusseau, André Moan, Paula Gutiérrez Muñoz, Morgane Pommier, Henrik Pärn, Kim Magnus Bærum, Amaia Astarloa Diaz.
WGBYC ToR C members contributed significantly to non-coding development and beta testing, particularly Marjorie Lyssikatos, Ailbhe Kavanagh, Caterina Fortuna, Guðjón Már Sigurðsson, Katja Ringdahl, Sara Königson, Ruth Fernandez, Allen Kingston, Lotte Kindt-Larsen and Carlos Pinto.

The efforts to get BEAM to TAF are led by André Moan.

BEAM is being benchmarked by ICES 1.5 December, come back for updates after that week. We advise now to use the Rmd script to run through the BEAM functions (rather than BEAM v2, which will be updated to BEAM v3 after the benchmark).
